Sequence Containers

This directory contains implementations of sequence containers for the MySTL project. Currently, it includes only the vector implementation, but over time it will be expanded to 
include other sequence containers such as:

  list
  deque
  array
  forward_list

The goal is to provide STL-like sequence container implementations that are clean, intuitive, and modular, following proper design principles. Each container will be implemented separately,
with its own iterators and supporting utilities, to make understanding and testing easier.

Current status

  Vector: implemented and pushed
  Other containers: planned for future updates

This directory will serve as the main hub for all sequence container implementations in MySTL.
