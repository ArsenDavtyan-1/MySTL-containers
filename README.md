Sequence Containers

This directory contains implementations of sequence containers for the MySTL project. 

Currently, the following containers are available:
    vector
    forward_list

More sequence containers will be added in the future, including:
    list
    deque
    array

The goal is to provide STL-like implementations that are clear, modular, and close to the real STL design. Each container is developed with an emphasis on clean separation of concerns,
readability, and educational value.

Current status
    vector: implemented
    forward_list: implemented
    Other containers: planned

This directory acts as the central place for all sequence container implementations in MySTL.
